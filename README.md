MyLibrary is a project for the course Software Project Management at International Burch University, with a focus on Product Management within Agile methodology. 

My colleague Anja Å ehovac and I created a detailed strategy which accounts for planning and analysis of an innovative AI-powered web library platform called MyLibrary.

This project aims to plan for MyLibrary as a product from its inception to the detailed breakdown of features and how they impact user's experience.

The project deliverables include: 
      - Product Vision 
      - Goal-Oriented Product Roadmap 
      - Prioritized Product Backlog 
      - User Stories with estimations
      - Wireframes
