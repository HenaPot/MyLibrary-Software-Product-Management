MyLibrary is a project for the course Software Project Management at International Burch University. 

My colleague Anja Å ehovac and I created a detailed streategy which accounts for planning and analysis of an innovative web library platform - MyLibrary.

This project aims to plan for MyLibrary as a product from its inception to the detailed breakdown of features and how they impact user's experience.

The project deliverables include: product vision, goal-oriented product roadmap, prioritized backlog, user stories with estimations and their corresponding wireframes.
